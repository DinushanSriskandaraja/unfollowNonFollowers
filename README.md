# Instagram Followers Thief Identifier

## Introduction

Welcome! This repository contains a Python script designed to help you identify "followers thieves" on Instagram. A "followers thief" is someone who follows you first, waits until you follow them back, and then unfollows you to appear more popular on social media.

## Instructions

### Step 1: Download Your Instagram Data

1. **Access Your Instagram Settings:**
   - Open the Instagram app and tap on the menu icon (three horizontal lines) in the bottom right corner.
   - Select "Settings" (gear icon).

2. **Navigate to Your Information:**

   - Once downloaded, unzip the folder to access its contents.

### Step 2: Prepare Your Data for Analysis

1. **Locate Followers and Following Lists:**
   - Within the unzipped folder, look for files named `followers.html` and `following.html`.
   - These files contain your Instagram followers and following lists.

2. **Move Files to Script Folder:**
   - Copy the `followers.html` and `following.html` files from the unzipped folder.
   - Paste them into the same folder where you have saved the `instagram_followers_thief_identifier.py` script from this repository.

### Step 3: Run the Python Script

1. **Install Required Libraries:**
   - Ensure you have Python installed on your computer.
   - Install BeautifulSoup library if not already installed:
     ```bash
     pip install beautifulsoup4
     ```

2. **Run the Script:**
   - Open your command prompt or terminal.
   - Navigate to the directory where you saved `instagram_followers_thief_identifier.py`.
     ```bash
     cd path/to/your/directory
     ```
   - Run the script:
     ```bash
     python instagram_followers_thief_identifier.py
     ```
   - Follow the prompts on the screen to choose whether to identify followers not following back or following not following you back.

3. **Review Results:**
